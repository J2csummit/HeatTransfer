%% Design Project - Heat Sink %%

% As a means of enhancing heat transfer from high-performance logic chips, 
% it is common to attach a heat sink to the chip surface in order to increase 
% the surface area for convection heat transfer. Because of the ease with 
% which it may be manufactured (by taking orthogonal sawcuts in a block of 
% material), an attractive option is to use a heat sink consisting of an array 
% of square fins of width w on a side. The spacing between adjoining fins would 
% be determined by the width of the sawblade, with the sum of this spacing and 
% the fin width designated as the fin pitch S. The method by which the heat sink 
% is joined to the chip would determine the interfacial contact resistance, R?t,c.

% Consider a square chip of width Wc = 16 mm and conditions for which cooling 
% is provided by a dielectric liquid with T? = 25?C and h = 1500 W/m2-K. The 
% heat sink is fabricated from copper (k = 400 W/m-K) and its characteristic 
% dimensions are w = 0.25 mm, and S = 0.50 mm, Lf = 6 mm, and Lb = 3 mm. The 
% prescribed values of w and S represent minima imposed manufacturing constraints 
% and the need to maintain adequate flow in the passages between fins.

%% Part A %%

% (a)	If a metallurgical joint provides a contact resistance of R?t,
% c = 5 x 10-6 m2-K/W and the maximum allowable chip temperature is 85?C,
% what is the maximum allowable chip power dissipation qc? It can be assumed 
% that all of the heat to be transferred through the sink

heatSink(0.25, 6)

%% Part B %%

% (b)	It may be possible to increase the heat dissipation by increasing w, 
% subject to the constraint that (S ? w) ? 0.25 mm and/or increasing Lf  
% (subject to manufacturing constraints that Lf  ? 10 mm). Assess the effects
% of such changes for w = 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, and 0.50 mm and 
% Lf  = 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mm.

% Intialize varying properties
w = [0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50];
l = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

% Intialize array to store Q values
q = zeros(length(w), length(l));

% Loop through all values
i = 1; j = 1;
while i <= length(w)
    while j <= length(l)
        q(i, j) = heatSink(w(i), l(j));
        j = j + 1;
    end
    i = i + 1;
    j = 1;
end
